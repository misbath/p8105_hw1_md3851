## Problem 1
### Part 1: Creating a table 

```{r problem 1, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
example_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(8),
  norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0,
  vec_char = c("This", "is", "an", "assignment", "for", "data", "science", "class"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("small", "medium", "large", "small", "medium", "large", "small", "small"))
)
example_df
```

### Part 2: Understanding the nature of variables  

### Part 3: Converting variables 

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
